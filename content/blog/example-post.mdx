# Building Decentralized Systems: Lessons from VigilNet

As I work on VigilNet, a secure network designed to browse onion, Loki, and I2P sites while hopping messages across multiple protocols, I've learned valuable lessons about what it truly means to build decentralized systems.

## The Vision

The goal is ambitious: create a network where every device acts as both server and client, contributing to a system that becomes stronger and more resilient as more users join. No central servers, no single points of failure, just pure peer-to-peer architecture.

## Key Challenges

### 1. Network Discovery
How do peers find each other without a central directory? We're implementing a hybrid approach:
- DHT (Distributed Hash Table) for peer discovery
- Local network scanning for nearby nodes
- Bootstrap nodes that help initial connections

### 2. Message Routing
Ensuring messages reach their destination while maintaining privacy requires careful consideration of:
- Onion routing for anonymity
- Multiple protocol support (Wi-Fi, cellular, Bluetooth, radio)
- Fallback mechanisms when primary routes fail

### 3. Scalability
The network must handle growth gracefully:
- Efficient routing algorithms that don't degrade with size
- Load balancing across available nodes
- Automatic adaptation to network topology changes

## Modular Architecture

One of my core principles is modularity. VigilNet is built as interconnected modules that can be:
- Swapped out for different implementations
- Reused in other projects
- Updated independently
- Mixed and matched based on needs

```typescript
// Example module interface
interface NetworkModule {
  initialize(): Promise<void>
  connect(peer: PeerInfo): Promise<Connection>
  disconnect(peerId: string): void
  sendMessage(message: Message, route: Route): Promise<void>
}
```

## Privacy by Design

Every decision prioritizes user privacy:
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- No logging of user activities
- Metadata protection through traffic analysis resistance
- Optional Tor integration for additional anonymity layers

## The Future

VigilNet represents more than just another networking project. It's a step toward a future where:
- Censorship becomes technically impossible
- Privacy is the default, not an afterthought
- Users control their own data and communications
- Networks become more resilient through decentralization

## Open Source Philosophy

As always, VigilNet will be fully open source. FOSS is one of my biggest philosophies â€” free as in freedom. The code, documentation, and research will be available for anyone to audit, contribute to, or learn from.

The future of the internet should be decentralized, private, and controlled by its users, not corporations or governments. Projects like VigilNet are small steps toward that vision.
